## Task

#### 1. Explore

1. Take some time to explore the code, take a look at the files and the comments and the code itself.
2. Talk it out. Discuss it with your fellow developers.
3. Ask questions. That's what we're here for.

#### 2. Fetch All Books

1. In `App.js`, fetch all the books from the following API: `https://the-index-api.herokuapp.com/api/books/`
(Hint: this will be almost identical to how the authors are being fetched in `componentDidMount`)

#### 3. `BookList` Components

1. Create a `BookList` component that displays a list of books, their author(s), and color.
2. Add a new route to the app router for `/books` that renders `BookList`.
3. Make sure to send the fetched books to the `BookList` component.
4. Add a new link in the sidebar that takes you to `/books`.
5. Implement a functioning search bar that can filter through the books.
6. Turn the names of the authors into links that take you to their detail page.

#### 4. Books By Color

1. Clicking on the color of a book should filter the book list to display only books with that color.  
  *(e.g. clicking on a `blue` button will take me to `/books/blue` which is the book list but only showing books that are `blue`.)*
